# In-season-forecasting-of-growth-parameters-using-LSTM-models
In our model, a comparative study of different Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models to predict the canopy cover, canopy height and excessive green indices of cotton crops have been carried out using training datasets generated by K-Means clustering and Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) techniques of data modeling. Using the predicted parameters of canopy features, in-season management decisions can be made to regulate the use of pesticides and fertilizers so as to obtain optimal yield of cotton crop at the end of the harvesting period.
